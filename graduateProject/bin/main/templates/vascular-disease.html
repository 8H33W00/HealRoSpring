                노화입니다. 피부에 주름 또는 얼룩이 생기고 피부가 쳐지는 것처럼, 혈관도 연령과 함께 다치고 약해지며, 유연함도 저하됩니다. 단지 피부의 노화와 다른 것은
                생명과 관계되는 노화라는 것입니다. 외관상으로는 알 수 없기 때문에 대부분의 사람이 혈관의 노화는 깨닫지 못하고 방치해 두고 있습니다. 그 결과, 혈액이 가는
                길이 좁아지거나 혈전이 생겨 혈관이 꽉 차, 어느 날 갑자기 심근경색이나 뇌졸중이라는 심각한 병을 일으킵니다.</p>

                            <br/>
                            There are several ways in which a heartbeat can lose its regular rhythm. These include:<br/>
                            <br/>
                            - tachycardia, when the heart beats too fast<br/>
                            - bradycardia, when the heart beats too slowly<br/>
                            - premature ventricular contractions, or additional, abnormal beats<br/>
                            - fibrillation, when the heartbeat is irregular<br/>
                            <br/>
                            Arrhythmias occur when the electrical impulses in the heart that coordinate the heartbeat do
                            not<br/>
                            work properly. These make the heart beat in a way it should not, whether that be too fast,
                            too<br/>
                            slowly, or too erratically.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            Irregular heartbeats are common, and all people experience them. They feel like a fluttering
                            or<br/>
                            a racing heart. However, when they change too much or occur because of a damaged or weak
                            heart,<br/>
                            they need to be taken more seriously and treated.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            Arrhythmias can become fatal.<br/>

                            Coronary arteries can become diseased or damaged, usually because of plaque deposits that
                            contain cholesterol. Plaque buildup narrows the coronary arteries, and this causes the heart
                            to
